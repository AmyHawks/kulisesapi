Hi! This is a part of my bachelor thesis "Mobile Application for Show Viewing and Ticketing System"

The aim of the bachelor's thesis is to develop an API service and an Android mobile application "Kulises", which will collect all information about performances and provide the opportunity to view all performances in Latvia in one application.

The developed system, named "Kulises," consists of three subsystems: 1)Android mobile application for end-users; 2)Administrator web application; 3) REST service.

The mobile application is designed to provide theater enthusiasts with easy access to all information about upcoming shows. It enables users to conveniently and easily learn about new shows, read descriptions, and purchase tickets online.
The administrator web application is designed for entering information about current shows. It is based on the Django content management system. The REST service facilitates information exchange between the web application and the mobile application.

This is an old work that hasn't been published at the Google Play Store or anywhere online. It was a personal experiment, if I could personally develop both front-end and back-end successfully, using Flutter framework and Django REST API.
It also haven't been updated in quite a while, so to see how it was working on Android emulator with all the administration and backend, you can view it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y392gd0xg0
